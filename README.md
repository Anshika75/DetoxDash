# Detox Dash
Detox Dash is a platform committed to fostering positive lifestyle choices among teenagers through engaging features that empower and connect users.

## Features

### 1. Anti-Drug RPG: Embark on a transformative journey with our mobile RPG, where players navigate challenges like peer pressure and addiction. Earn points for healthy decisions and overcoming obstacles, unlocking rewards, social recognition, and exclusive content. Think of it as "Pokemon Go" for making positive choices in real life.

### 2. Peer-to-Peer Storytelling: Move beyond celebrity endorsements. Detox Dash collaborates with diverse teen micro-influencers who share authentic experiences of resisting drugs or overcoming delinquency. Real stories resonate more than distant stars, creating a relatable and encouraging environment.

### 3. Hyperlocal Challenges: Engage with your local community by participating in hyperlocal challenges on platforms like Snapchat or Instagram. Document acts of community service spread positivity, and showcase the benefits of healthy choices. Partner with local youth groups and community centers for a powerful impact.

### 4. Community Engagement Hub: Connect with like-minded individuals in the app's dedicated space. Share achievements, support each other, and build a sense of belonging through forums, group challenges, and community events. Our community hub is designed to encourage positive interactions and mutual encouragement.

### 5. Notifications and Reminders
Never miss an opportunity to make a positive impact. The Notifications page keeps you informed about updates, events, and achievements. You can also schedule reminders to stay on track with your personal goals and community engagements.

### 6. Duty Assignments
Assign roles to users with a Duty Assign page. Introduce four roles - admin, mod, YouTube influencer, and user - each with specific responsibilities. This feature ensures a well-organized and smoothly managed community.
